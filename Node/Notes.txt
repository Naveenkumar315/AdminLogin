npm init
npm i express mongoose cors nodemon

1. create server.js
2. .env created
3. gitignore added
4. db file created
5. to create Rest Api 
   1. create router file. write router function and export that.
   2. import into server file. in router file we can import the api file link.


JWT Token:
Access Token: This token infinite expire time, we can use only one time and this has limited time to access.
Refresh Token: Once the access key used that will be expired, so with the help of Refresh key we can generate one new access key.

apiClient - we need set the token to the headers, and then give cors origin access for the token key also in server file.

errors:
1. Use the optional chaining operator (?) to handle situations where a variable may be undefined, null, or empty, preventing unwanted errors.
2. Utilize the optional chaining operator (?) to avoid unintended errors when accessing properties in a chain, especially when dealing with undefined or null values.
3. When performing calculations and assigning values, ensure that the variables being added have a valid numeric value, checking for '0' or other conditions as needed before the addition operation.
4. In a loop, ensure that there is a check to confirm the array or collection has a minimum length of 1 before proceeding with the iteration.
5. we can destructure the response objects { name } = res.body. it is easy for readability.

6. http://localhost:3000 - url
   "/books" - this called end point
